🛒 E-Commerce Backend (Spring Boot) 📌 Project Description

This project is a backend system for an e-commerce platform built using Spring Boot. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, product management, cart operations, order processing, and payment integration using Stripe.

The system is designed with secure authentication, proper database relationships, and scalable architecture following industry best practices.

🚀 Features 🔐 Authentication & Authorization User registration and login using JWT Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN) Secure password hashing using BCrypt Stateless session management using Spring Security 📦 Product Management Create, update, delete products (Admin only) View all products Stock validation before order placement 🛒 Cart Management Add items to cart Remove items from cart Clear cart Each user has a unique cart Prevent duplicate cart creation 📑 Order Management Create order from cart Convert CartItems → OrderItems View user-specific orders Order contains product details and total price Proper entity relationships (Order ↔ OrderItem) 💳 Payment Integration Integrated with Stripe API Create PaymentIntent for secure payments Environment-based API key configuration 🛠️ Tech Stack Java Spring Boot Spring Security JWT Authentication Hibernate (JPA) PostgreSQL Stripe API Maven ⚙️ Setup Instructions 1️⃣ Clone Repository git clone cd ecommerce-backend 2️⃣ Configure Database

Update application.properties:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ecomDB spring.datasource.username=postgres spring.datasource.password=${1234} spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update spring.jpa.show-sql=true 3️⃣ Configure JWT Secret jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET:dev_secret}

Set environment variable:

Windows setx JWT_SECRET "your_secure_jwt_key" 4️⃣ Configure Stripe Key stripe.secret.key=${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:sk_test_dummy}

Set environment variable:

setx STRIPE_SECRET_KEY "sk_test_your_secret_key" 5️⃣ Run Application mvn spring-boot:run 📡 API Endpoints 🔐 Authentication POST /api/auth/register → Register user POST /api/auth/login → Login & get JWT 📦 Products GET /api/products → Get all products POST /api/products → Create product (ADMIN) PUT /api/products/{id} → Update product (ADMIN) DELETE /api/products/{id} → Delete product (ADMIN) 🛒 Cart GET /api/cart → Get cart POST /api/cart/add?productId=&qty= → Add item DELETE /api/cart/remove/{id} → Remove item DELETE /api/cart/clear → Clear cart 📑 Orders POST /api/orders → Create order GET /api/orders → Get user orders GET /api/orders/{id} → Get order 💳 Payment POST /api/payment/create-intent?amount= → Create payment 🔐 Security Highlights JWT-based authentication Role-based authorization (ADMIN / USER) BCrypt password encryption Environment-based secrets (JWT, DB, Stripe) Stateless API security ✅ Improvements Implemented ✔ Fixed cart duplication issue (one cart per user) ✔ Implemented proper order creation flow ✔ Added stock validation ✔ Fixed entity relationships (Order ↔ OrderItem) ✔ Secured APIs with role-based authorization ✔ Removed hardcoded secrets ✔ Added global exception handling 🧠 Future Enhancements Payment webhook handling (Stripe) Order status tracking (PAID, SHIPPED, DELIVERED) Pagination & filtering Admin dashboard APIs Logging & monitoring 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete backend system for an e-commerce platform with secure authentication, proper business logic, and scalable architecture using Spring Boot..
